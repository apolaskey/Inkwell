This was a capstone project for college; kept around for historical reasons.

Built on-top of XNA and C# 4.0 this was a team of students attempt at making a Paper-Mario like game using an Alice in Wonderland Lore

In order to build and run you will need the XNA gameframework from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=20914

Visual Studio 2010 will most likely also be required; express versions should be fine to open the solution files.
